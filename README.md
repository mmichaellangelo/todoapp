# ToDo
<span style="color:red">WORK IN PROGRESS</span>

This is a simple but completely overengineered todo app.

The purpose of this app is to help me learn how to build a full-stack application, so I decided to stick to something simple that I can finish in a reasonable amount of time.

The frontend web application is built with SvelteKit and the backend api is written in Go.

Postgres serves as the database with Adminer for database admin things.

The whole stack is dockerized and can be run with docker compose.
